Abstract
	Machine learning (ML) has grown over a wide range of sectors such as finance, education, communication, transportation, retail, and healthcare. Due to this, researchers have developed a variety of algorithms to analyze a large amount of data and derive quantifiable insights from it. The organizations may have data in text, image, audio, video, and numeric formats and machine learning can be used to create programs for speech recognition, natural language processing, computer vision, and recommendation systems. In this paper, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) machine learning algorithm is proposed to solve classification problems. KNN classifier groups the data into clusters 
and classifies the input data based on its similarity with trained data. The input is assigned to that class with which it shares the most nearest neighbors. The model is integrated with Neocortex API and gets the input data sequence from its Multi-sequence learning model. In the primary stage, the model gets trained and then produces the sequential output based on the KNN model with 80-85% accuracy. Additionally, the design procedure, challenges, and enhancements to improve model accuracy are discussed in the paper.
